[metalsmith](metalsmith.io) plugin to detect mime types from file contents

This plugin is a thin wrapper around
[mmmagic](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mmmagic) which inspects the contents of
files to determine mime type rather than simply looking up the file extension

Take a look at the
[annotated source](https://leviwheatcroft.github.io/metalsmith-mime-type/lib/index.js.html)



## install

`npm i --save metalsmith-mime-type`

## usage

```
mimeType = require('metalsmith-mime-type')

metalsmith(__dirname)
.use(mimeType(['**/*','!*.jpg']))
.build(callback)
```

## options

A single option, `src` is used as a minimatch mask to determine what files
need to to have mimetypes assigned. can be passed in as an object property,
or as a string. See usage example.

## compatibility

`dist/index.js` is fully compatible with Node 6.3.1

`dist/node4/index.js` is fully compatible with Node 4 LTS, require it like so:
`var mimeType = require('metalsmith-mime-type/dist/node4')`
